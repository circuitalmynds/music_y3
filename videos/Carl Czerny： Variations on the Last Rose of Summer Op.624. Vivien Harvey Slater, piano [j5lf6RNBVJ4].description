Carl Czerny (1791-1857): Variations on "The Last Rose of Summer" from "Les Fleurs d'Irlande", Op.624. (Thomas Moore traditional Irish melody). Vivien Harvey Slater, piano. Vivien Slater made a specialty of performing the works of Carl Czerny, and recorded 5 LPs of his music. This set of variations was one she performed a number of times in the 1980's and 1990's. I've never found another performance of the work. Vivien frequented music libraries during her trips to Europe, and presumably copied this score from one of these library archives.
