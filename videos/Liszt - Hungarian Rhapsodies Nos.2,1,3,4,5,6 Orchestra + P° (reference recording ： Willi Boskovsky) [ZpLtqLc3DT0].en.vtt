Though Liszt's parentage was Austrian, his upbringing had a Hungarian bias, and this affected a creative development which also owed something to influences from Germany, Poland and France.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:30.958
In a sustained effort to rouse interest in Hungarian national music, Liszt published ten volumes which he called Magyar Dallok and Magyar Rhapsodiak; further, he wrote a book entitled The Gypsies and their music in Hungary.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:44.903
Material for these collections of Magyar melodies formed the basis of 15 of the 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies which he composed initially as piano soli. Six were orchestrated by Franz Doppler, a flautist, conductor and composer well known to Liszt.

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:58.880
But it is generally considered that some of the instrumentation was by Liszt himself; certainly, the dark colourings which figure so prominently in these works are typical of a good deal of Liszt's other orchestral music.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:15.861
Not all the melodies collected by Liszt were first-hand originals. Some represented second- or third-hand workings of tunes
picked up and embroidered by various peripatetic musicians. Musicological research was an infant affair in the middle of the nineteenth century, and Liszt is not to be criticized for a certain innocence in the face of his teeming raw material. END
