One of Chopin's most brilliant and compelling early concertante works. Weissenberg's rendition is refreshingly direct and clear, and the numerous fiorituras are, interestingly, played as if they are important structural elements of the melody as opposed to mere decoration. The more brilliant passages (in contrast to, say, Argerich or Zimerman, whose recordings are also fantastic) are played more slowly and robustly than is the norm, which makes for interesting listening.
