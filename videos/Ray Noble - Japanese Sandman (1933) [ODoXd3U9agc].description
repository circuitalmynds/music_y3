Ray Noble (1903 - 1978) was a leader of outstanding English and US dance bands of impeccable musicianship and taste, deep ensemble sound, strong beat and a sweet swinging style. With his extensive musical training at the Royal Academy of Music, he was also an accomplished pianist and arranger.  Noble was musical director of HMV Records in England 1929-1934 and led the New Mayfair Orchestra which featured English show and novelty tunes.  The band developed and took on the Noble name and began recording US song hits and lilting English tunes. Noble came to the US in late 1934 and brought singer Al Bowlly and drummer-manager Bill Harty.  His US musicians included Glenn Miller (trombone, arranger), Pee Wee Erwin (trumpet), Charlie Spivak (trumpet), Sterling Bose, Will Bradley, Milt Yarner, Johnny Mince, Bud Freeman, Claude Thornhill, and George Van Eps.  He recorded for HMV, Victor, Brunswick and Columbia record companies and was featured at New York's Rainbow Room.  He performed on Radio including the Burns and Allen Show through the 1940s and into the 1950s on the Edgar Bergan & Charlie McCarthy Show. Noble retired in the mid 1950s but continued to spend time in both England and the US.
